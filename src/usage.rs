// usage.rs — how often you actually reach for something, and when that is allowed to move it.
//
// Two separate ideas, and conflating them is the classic mistake:
//
//   1. WHAT you use, as a moving average. A raw launch count says a thing you used fifty times
//      last year beats a thing you used twice this morning. An exponentially-weighted score with a
//      half-life says the opposite, which is what "frequently used" actually means to a person,
//      and it needs no history to be stored -- one number and a timestamp per entry.
//
//   2. WHETHER the difference is real. This is the part every naive frecency implementation skips,
//      and it is why they feel unusable: they re-sort on every launch, so the thing you are aiming
//      at slides out from under the cursor while you are reaching for it. A spatial launcher's
//      entire speed advantage is that positions are learnable, and an order that reshuffles on
//      noise destroys exactly that.
//
// So ordering here is not a sort. It starts from the CURRENT order and only swaps neighbours when
// the evidence clears a statistical bar -- adjacent bubble passes, gated. Positions hold still
// under noise and move only when the difference is real, which is the whole of the requirement.
